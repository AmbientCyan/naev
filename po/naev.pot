#. Cooldown preempts everything we haven't explicitly checked for.
#. If the ship is hot and shields are high, consider cooling down.
#. Ship is quite hot, better cool down.
#. Cool down if the current weapon set is suffering from >= 20% accuracy loss.

#. Make sure target exists
#. Make sure pilot is setting their target properly
#. Ships should always defend their brethren.
#. We don't want to cause a complete breakdown in social order.
#. Aggressive ships follow their brethren into battle!
#. When your allies are fighting, stay out of it.
#. Victim is an ally, but the attacker isn't.
#. Victim isn't an ally. Attack the victim if the attacker is our ally.
#. If they're both enemies, may as well let them destroy each other.
#. We'll be nice and go after the aggressor if the victim is peaceful.
#. An aggressive, neutral ship is fighting another neutral ship. Who cares?
#. Non-aggressive ships will flee if their enemies attack neutral or allied vessels.
#. We're sort of busy
#. If not fleeing or refueling, begin attacking
#. Handles generating distress messages
#. Must have a valid distress rate
#. Only generate distress if have been attacked before
#. Initialize if unset.
#. Update distress counter
#. See if it's time to trigger distress
#. Picks an appropriate weapon set for ships with mixed weaponry.

#. --
#. Use both if both are cool, or if both are similar in temperature.
#. Both sets are similarly hot.
#. An extremely-hot weapon is a good reason to pick another set.
#. Puts the pilot into cooldown mode if its weapons are overly hot and its shields are relatively high.
#. This can happen during combat, so mem.heatthreshold should be quite high.
#. Don't want to cool down again so soon.
#. By default, 15 ticks will be 30 seconds.
#. The weapons are extremely hot and cooldown should be triggered.
#. This did not work before. However now it causes ships to just stop dead and wait for energy regen.

"isn't looking too closely you will appear as an FLF ship. Of course, this "
"alone is not enough. The FLF will assume you know where their base is, since "
"you look like one of them.\"\n"
"    The image on the wall updates again, this time showing several House "
"Dvaered crests near your ship.\n"
"    \"Some time after you enter the system, several of our military assets "
"will jump in and open fire. To the FLF, it will look like one of their own "

"We will therefore conduct our assault in two phases.\"\n"

#. MISSION: Defend the System 1
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.
#.
#. TO DO
#. Make comm chatter appear during the battle
#. Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission
#.
#.
#. This section stores the strings (text) for the mission.
#. Mission details
#. Create the mission on the current planet, and present the first Bar text.
#. hook an abstract deciding function to player entering a system
#. hook warm reception to player landing
#. If player didn't accept the mission, the battle's still on, but player has no stake.
#. hook an abstract deciding function to player entering a system when not part of defense
#. Decides what to do when player either takes off starting planet or jumps into another system
#. There's a battle to defend the system
#. Makes the system empty except for the two fleets. No help coming.
#. Set up distances
#. Create a fleet of raiding pirates
#. And a fleet of defending independents
#. How the Battle ends:
#. hook fleet departure to disabling or killing ships
#. Record each raider death and make the raiders flee after too many casualties
#. A few seconds after the raiders start to flee declare victory
#. Call ships back to base
#. The player lands to a warm welcome (if the job is done).
#. If any pirates still alive, send player back out.
#. A fellow warrior says hello in passing if player jumps out of the system without landing
#.
#.
#. MISSION: Defend the System 2
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the second in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third mission, perhaps there'll be a regular diet of similar missions
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.
#.
#. TO DO
#. Make comm chatter appear during the battle
#. Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission
#.
#.
#. This section stores the strings (text) for the mission.
#. Mission details
#. Create the mission on the current planet, and present the first Bar text.
#. hook an abstract deciding function to player entering a system
#. hook warm reception to player landing
#. If player didn't accept the mission, the battle's still on, but player has no stake.
#. hook an abstract deciding function to player entering a system when not part of defense
#. Decides what to do when player either takes off starting planet or jumps into another system
#. There's a battle to defend the system
#. Makes the system empty except for the two fleets. No help coming.
#. Set up distances
#. Create a fleet of raiding pirates
#. And a fleet of defending independents
#. Set conditions for the end of the Battle:
#. hook fleet departure to disabling or killing ships
#. Record each raider death and make the raiders flee after too many casualties
#. A few seconds after victory, the system is back under control
#. When the raiders are on the run then the Empire takes over
#. Call ships to base
#. Get a position near the player for late Empire re-enforcements
#. The player lands to a warm welcome (if the job is done).
#. If any pirates still alive, send player back out.

"    \"And he thought he could out-fly them,\" a woman's voice pipes up. \"My "
"husband used to be a bit of a pilot, but that was back when we were still "
"dating. He would fly all the way to the Apez system to see me! Before we had "
"children...\" The woman trails off.\n"
"    The man quickly speaks up again. \"The pirates disabled our ship and we "
"thought we were goners, but when they boarded us, they took our three "
"children and left us! I tried to fight them, but they had my children with "
"knives to their necks... what was I supposed to do? So we got a tow back to "
"Brooks, but now we need to find someone who will rescue our children. We've "

"than later. \"Yes, quite right,\" the father replies. \"No need to delay any "
"longer than absolutely necessary. I don't know a whole lot, but you should "
"be able to eavesdrop on some pirates at a bar. The bar in %s on %s has been "
"known to serve pirates occasionally, so stopping there would be a good "
"course of action. We will anticipate your return. Again, this means so much "
"to us.\" Before you know it, the two parents are at it again, thanking you "
"like it's all they know how to do. Before it gets really bad, you bid "
"farewell, break communication, and get on your way."

"you. Clearly the Seiryuu is not just any other Kestrel.\n"
"    On the bridge, you immediately spot - who else - the Seiryuu's captain, "
"Rebina, seated in the captain's chair. The chair, too, is designed in the "
"strange fashion that you've been seeing all over the ship. It sports several "
"controls that you can't place, despite the fact that you're an experienced "
"pilot yourself. The rest of the bridge is no different. All the regular "
"stations and consoles seem to be there, but there are some others whose "
"purpose you can only guess.\n"
"    Rebina swivels the chair around and smiles when she sees you. \"Ah, %s,"

"invitation, since I was quite pleased with your performance last time. And "
"I'm not the only one. As it turns out Jorek seems to have taken a liking to "

#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or sructure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.

#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy

#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.

#. Player has no ability to fix whatever's wrong, definitely stuck.

#. Don't keep iterating after a table.remove, as it can cause trouble.
#. can't have a fleet with one ship.
#. Now, if our fleet has been completely wiped out, we need to clean up.
#. if the scripter set a lead ship which dies, set the lead_ship to nil.
#. We need to update the fleet's organization if the leader got killed.
#. Update the ship count if the formation is "buffer".
#. Jump hook. Ensures the entire fleet jumps if the fleader jumps.
#. Takes an ID that tells this function which formation the pilot belonged to.
#. Jumping out is the same as dying, for our purpose; we need to not run this before the if statement.
#. Make the whole fleet use the jump.
#. control pilots or clear their orders.
#. Stop the control loop, or it will override our hyperspace() order.
#. we need to not run this before the if statement.
#. Land hook. Ensures the entire fleet lands if the fleader lands.
#. Takes an ID that tells this function which formation the pilot belonged to.
#. Landing is the same as dying, for our purpose.
#. Have the fleet land on the asset.
#. control pilots or clear their orders.
#. Stop the control loop, or it will override our land() order.
#. Hooks. The hook functions are just wrappers for the Forma functions.
#. We need these because hooks can't reference table elements as their callbacks.
#. Used in formation creation, this creates vec2s for each ship to follow.
#. Defined on a formation table.
#. This is where formations will ultimately be defined.
#. setup
#. position array. I'm using this twice, once for polar coordinates and once for absolute vec2s.
#. Readability.
#. A fleet of 1 ship or less has no business flying in formation.
#. cross formation
#. Cross logic. Forms an X.
#. Spokes start rotated at a 45 degree angle.
#. First ship distance.
#. Store as polar coordinates.
#. Rotate spokes by 90 degrees.
#. Increase the radius every 4 positions.
#. buffer formation
#. Buffer logic. Consecutive arcs eminating from the fleader. Stored as polar coordinates.
#. Different radii for each class.
#. Need to keep track of positions already iterated through.
#. For readability.
#. If there's only one ship in this specific class...
#. The angle needs to be zero.
#. If there's more than one ship in each class...
#. ..the angle rotates from -45 degrees to 45 degrees, assigning coordinates at even intervals.
#. Update the count
#. Assign the radius, defined above.
#. vee formation
#. The vee formation forms a v, with the fleader at the apex, and the arms extending in front.
#. Arms start at a 45 degree angle.
#. First ship distance.
#. Store as polar coordinates.
#. Flip the arms between -45 and 45 degrees.
#. Increase the radius every 2 positions.
#. wedge formation
#. The wedge formation forms a v, with the fleader at the apex, and the arms extending out back.
#. First ship distance.
#. Store as polar coordinates.
#. Flip the arms between 135 and 215 degrees.
#. Increase the radius every 2 positions.
#. This formation forms a "/", with the fleader in the middle.
#. Flip between 45 degrees and 225 degrees.
#. Increase the radius every 2 positions
#. This formation forms a "\", with the fleader in the middle.
#. Flip between 315 degrees, and 135 degrees
#. This formation is a simple "|", with fleader in the middle.
#. flip between 0 degrees and 180 degrees
#. Increase the radius every 2 ships.
#. This formation is a "-", with the fleader in the middle.
#. flip between 90 degrees and 270 degrees
#. Increase the radius every 2 ships.
#. Default to circle.
#. The angle between each ship, in radians.
#. Pulling these numbers out of my ass. The point being that more ships mean a bigger circle.
#. Store as polar coordinates.
#. We want a fleet formed in positions relative to the direction the
#. captain is facing, not static offests.
#. convert to radians
#. x coordinate assignment.
#. y coordinate assignment.
#. You can add and subtract vec2s as you would expect to, no need to bend over backwards.
#. Formation control function. A wrapper again.
#. Using false instead of nil for readability.
#. A little unconventional, re-set the timer hook at the start of the function. This is because execution might not reach the end.
#. Call the wrapper, not this function.
#. combat. mmmm.
#. Includes the player as an enemy to be iterated over.
#. Iterate over enemies to see if at least one is in range.
#. The inrange variable was already defaulted to false.
#. If an enemy is in range, no need to continue looping.
#. We want to seperate out the for loop that finds enemies and the if functions that control combat, so that all of the enemy pilots are iterated over to see if one is in range before controlling the pilots.
#. It's also easier on my brain. </lazy>
#. If baddies are in range and the fleet isn't set to do combat yet, then...
#. ...cut 'em loose.
#. No need to iterate further. No need to do the rest of this function either!
#. If baddies are in range, and the fleet was already in combat, no need to de-control them again. Prevents spam broadcasting.
#. If no badguys are in range...
#. ...and the fleet is no longer in combat, then...
#. ...flip the combat flag, and continue the function.
#. give the fleader his orders back
#. At this point we know we're not in combat (well, the leader isn't).
#. Assign the coordinates.
#. Remember, there is no need to check if a pilot exists, because we've already made sure all pilots exist.
#. Clear orders.
#. Computing the direction using a pd controller
#. Make mon capitan travel at 5 below the slow speed, so other ships can catch up.
#. Logic for fleet leader goes here. For now, let's allow the fleader to act according to the regular AI.
#. Task management
