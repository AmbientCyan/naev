"As you can see, having a hot ship is very inconvenient. It would be nice if "

"some ways to lose heat.\n"
"\n"
"First of all, ships radiate off heat if they are hotter than the space "
"around them. This happens automatically and continuously, but it is a "
"relatively slow process, especially for larger ships. It may be possible to "
"accelerate the rate of heat loss by installing outfits to that effect.\n"
"\n"
"Heat is also reset to the base level when you land. So every time you take "
"off, you will start out with a nice, cool hull.\n"

"Every ship has the ability to go into a special cooling mode called Active "
"Cooldown. When in Active Cooldown, ships rapidly lose their heat. By the end "
"of the cooldown cycle, the ship and all its outfits will have cooled to the "
"galactic base temperature.\n"
"\n"
"Let's try this now. If you're moving, press %s to begin braking, and then "
"press it again to enter Active Cooldown mode. When not moving, pressing %s "
"will immediately enter Active Cooldown mode."

"will be canceled and you will have to restart it.\n"
"\n"

"As you might have noticed during the cooldown process, your heat didn't drop "
"very quickly until the cooling process was almost over. This is because heat "
"is lost at an exponential rate in Active Cooldown mode. It starts off very "
"slow, but picks up a lot of speed over time. What this means is that when "
"using Active Cooldown, you're going to want to wait all the way until the "
"end. Active Cooldown always takes a minimum amount of time, and if you abort "
"the cooldown period, you have to start over from the beginning next time!\n"
"\n"
"Another important thing to remember is that Active Cooldown only works if "
"the ship is sitting still. You can't do it on the move! So while it might "
"seem attractive to use Active Cooldown in a fight to cool your weapons, you "
"make yourself very vulnerable by doing so."

"As you take the last empty seat at the table, Colonel Urnus starts the "
"meeting. \"Welcome, citizen. You know why you are here and you know what "
"this meeting is about, so let me get right to the point. We have reason to "
"believe the FLF terrorists are operating from a secret base of operations. "
"We know this base is located somewhere in the nebula, and we have recently "
"uncovered intel that indicates the base is likely to be in the %s system.\"\n"
"    One of the walls lights up, showing part of the galaxy map. The %s "
"system is colored red, and it's pulsating gently.\n"
"    \"Of course, we have conducted patrols in this system, but so far "
"without result. Our sensors are severely impaired by the nebula in this "
"system, so the chances of us finding the terrorist hive by our own devices "
"are slim. Fortunately, our top strategists have come up with a ruse, one "
"that will make the FLF come to us.\"\n"
"    \"We will use a civilian ship - your ship, naturally - as a decoy,\" "
"Urnus continues. The image on the wall zooms up to the %s system, and a "
"white blip representing your ship appears near the jump point. \"Your ship "
"will be equipped with an IFF transponder in use by the FLF, so to anyone who "
"isn't looking too closely you will appear as an FLF ship. Of course, this "
"alone is not enough. The FLF will assume you know where their base is, since "
"you look like one of them.\"\n"
"    The image on the wall updates again, this time showing several House "
"Dvaered crests near your ship.\n"
"    \"Some time after you enter the system, several of our military assets "
"will jump in and open fire. To the FLF, it will look like one of their own "
"has come under attack! Since their base is nearby, they will undoubtably "
"send reinforcements to help their 'comrade' out of a tight situation.\""

"\"As soon as the FLF ships join the battle, you and the Dvaered ships will "
"disengage and target the FLF instead. Your mission is to render at least one "
"of their ships incapable of fighting, and board it. You can then access the "
"ship's computer and download the flight log, which will include the location "
"of the FLF base. Take this information to a Dvaered base, and your mission "
"will be complete.\"\n"
"    The image on the wall updates one last time, simulating the battle as "
"described by Colonel Urnus. Several FLF logos appear, which are promptly "
"surrounded by the Dvaered ones. Then the logos turn gray, indicating that "
"they've been disabled.\n"
"    \"Let me make one thing clear, citizen. You are allowed, even expected "
"to fire on the Dvaered ships that are firing on you. However, you must make "
"it look you're on the losing side, or the FLF will not come to your aid! So, "
"do NOT disable or destroy any Dvaered ships, and make sure your own armor "
"takes a bit of a beating. This is vital to the success of the mission. Do "
"not fail.\"\n"
"    Colonel Urnus to have concluded his explanation, so you, having spotted "
"the obvious flaw in the Dvaereds' plan, pop the question of what happens if "
"the FLF never show up.\n"
"    \"Well,\" the Colonel muses, \"That will mean our intel was probably "
"wrong. But don't worry, citizen, we'll get those terrorists eventually! Now, "
"time is of the essence, so get to your ship and follow your orders. "
"Dismissed!\""

#.    DESCRIPTION: Take toxic waste and dump it over an uninhabited planet.
#. Mission conceived for the Shakar system.
#. It would begin at the mission computer on Zembla Shakar
#. To change the system, just change the mission.xml entry.
#. NOTES: This mission requires balancing to make sure it works with all ship types, possibly normalisation of the fraction of the top speed required for mission success according to the top speed, turn, and acceleration of the player's ship.

#.
#. An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.
#.
#. Thank you to Bobbens, Deiz, BTAxis, and others that have helped me with learning to use Lua and debugging my scripts in the IRC channel. Thanks as well to all those that have contributed to Naev and made it as great as it is today, and continue to make it better every day.

#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.

#. Hey, stealing a ship isn’t anything! (if you survive, that is)
#. Let’s keep a counter. Just in case we want to know how many you
#. stole in the future.
#. Stealing a ship for the first time increases your maximum faction
#. standing.
#. FIXME: We should add a few pursuers. However, if you were able to
#. fight a full squadron of whatever ships are used by the
#. faction to land on the planet, I say you have already done
#. enough. Still, I might be wrong. (:p)
#. If you stole a ship of some value, the faction will have something
#. to say, even if they can only suspect you.
#. This is a success. The player stole his new ship, and everyone is
#. happy with it. Getting out of the system alive is the player’s
#. responsibility, now.
#. A few faction ships guard the target planet.
#. We want the player to be able to land on the destination planet…
#. I’m not really sure what this is for, but in was in shadowrun.lua,
#. so I just kept it…
#. FIXME: Make the number of guarding ships (and therefor their
#. position) vary with the player’s rating, his pirate fame,
#. etc. The class of the ship on the ground should also
#. influence the number of guardians, or maybe the class of
#. ships guarding?
#. We don’t want the player to just land and be given his new ship…

#. Rescue script for stranded pilots.
#.
#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or sructure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.
#.

#. Slots that must be filled in order to take off.
#. Outfits equipped in required slots.
#. Array of empty required slots and their default outfits.

#. Rebuild tables, as we've added outfits.
#.
#.
#. Determines whether the player is stranded.
#.
#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
#. and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.
#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.
#.
#. --
#. Player has no ability to fix whatever's wrong, definitely stuck.
#. Get value of player's ship.
#. If the player can afford another ship, they're not stranded.
#. When all cores are equipped along with non-cores, it's nearly impossible
#. to determine where the problem lies, so let the player sort it out.
#. Add the player's other ships' outfits.
#. Add outfits sold by the outfitter.

#. First define the base object. There are no default values, I only wrote in the variables for reader reference.
#. The functions below that start with Forma: are all elements of the Forma table above.
#. Every such function is automatically passed the Forma object they are called on.
#. This object is referenced as "self".
#. Create a new object based on the Forma "class".

#. Combat flag, used in the controlling function.
#. Death function. Removes a pilot from a fleet and reorganizes the fleet if necessary.
#. This will automatically reorganize the table, so there won't be any entries for pilots that have been removed.
#. Don't keep iterating after a table.remove, as it can cause trouble.
#. can't have a fleet with one ship.
#. Now, if our fleet has been completely wiped out, we need to clean up.
#. if the scripter set a lead ship which dies, set the lead_ship to nil.
#. We need to update the fleet's organization if the leader got killed.
#. Update the ship count if the formation is "buffer".
#. Jump hook. Ensures the entire fleet jumps if the fleader jumps.
#. Takes an ID that tells this function which formation the pilot belonged to.
#. Jumping out is the same as dying, for our purpose; we need to not run this before the if statement.
#. Make the whole fleet use the jump.
#. control pilots or clear their orders.
#. Stop the control loop, or it will override our hyperspace() order.

#. Call the wrapper, not this function.
#. combat. mmmm.
#. Includes the player as an enemy to be iterated over.
#. Iterate over enemies to see if at least one is in range.
#. The inrange variable was already defaulted to false.
#. If an enemy is in range, no need to continue looping.
#. We want to seperate out the for loop that finds enemies and the if functions that control combat, so that all of the enemy pilots are iterated over to see if one is in range before controlling the pilots.
#. It's also easier on my brain. </lazy>
#. If baddies are in range and the fleet isn't set to do combat yet, then...
#. ...cut 'em loose.
#. No need to iterate further. No need to do the rest of this function either!
#. If baddies are in range, and the fleet was already in combat, no need to de-control them again. Prevents spam broadcasting.
#. If no badguys are in range...
#. ...and the fleet is no longer in combat, then...
#. ...flip the combat flag, and continue the function.
#. give the fleader his orders back
#. At this point we know we're not in combat (well, the leader isn't).
#. Assign the coordinates.
#. Remember, there is no need to check if a pilot exists, because we've already made sure all pilots exist.
#. Clear orders.
#. Computing the direction using a pd controller
#. Make mon capitan travel at 5 below the slow speed, so other ships can catch up.
#. Logic for fleet leader goes here. For now, let's allow the fleader to act according to the regular AI.
